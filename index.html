			<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>

			<h3>Legionaire</h3>
			<p>5.0 out of 5 stars. Not sure why I waited so long to get a decent headset
				March 30, 2018</p>
			<p>Color: GreenEdition: Headset + M60 (Xbox Only)Verified Purchase</p>
			<p>Buying these headphones was probably the best decision I've made as a console gamer. It's one of those things that you can't appreciate until you've tried it, and after you do, you know you could never go back to using cheap headsets again.
				These things are resilient, have great sound quality, and can be used with almost every console. Had to get a microphone/headphone splitter for the PC for like 10 bucks.</p>

			<h3>LENIN CESPEDES</h3>
			<p>5.0 out of 5 stars. Excellent
				March 7, 2018</p>
			<p>Color: GreenEdition: Headset + M60 (Xbox Only)Verified Purchase</p>
			<p>I bought it as a gift for my 13 year old son, and he was very happy with him he had the hyper cloud stinger and although these had a good sound these stars are better, more comfortable in the earmuffs, they look very resistant the cables are
				the greater problems of all the headphones but these are replaceable and I like them a lot, the microphone is perfect to talk and I think it is a good purchase.</p>
